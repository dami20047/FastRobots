## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Daniel Akinwale, and I am senior studying mechanical engineering at Cornell University. On campus I work in the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering as a manager of the Manufacturing Learning Studio. I teach students to use all sorts of machining tools like: laser cutters, 5-axis CNC mills, benchtop CNC mills, water jets, mills, lathes, vertical and horizontal saws, sanding tools, hand tools, etc. I have interned at SRW Engineering & Architecture as a Mechanical Engineering Intern as well as at GlobalFoundries as an Advanced Manufacturing Equipment Engineering Intern in the Photolithography Department.

I am detail-oriented with knowledge of design, prototyping, and process development. I’m eager to lend my combined knowledge and skills to enhance business performance. I operate well in both individual and team capacities, leveraging seasoned work ethic to quickly adapt to different processes and drive project objectives. I’m resourceful and results-driven with a passion for growth and the desire to increase the value of both my projects and myself.
