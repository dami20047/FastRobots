In MAE 4300, Engineers and Society, the focus was on understanding how engineering decisions exist within larger sociotechnical systems that include organizational structures, regulatory oversight, economic pressures, and public trust. Rather than treating ethics as an abstract concept, the course emphasized structured frameworks for identifying ethical issues, evaluating competing values, and understanding how real-world constraints influence engineering outcomes. Through a series of case-based analyses, the course developed tools for approaching complex decisions where technical performance, safety, and societal impact intersect.

A significant portion of the course centered on analyzing engineering failures by systematically identifying relevant facts at the material, individual, and organizational levels. This process highlighted how technical design choices, communication practices, and institutional incentives can collectively shape outcomes. By separating facts from assumptions and clarifying what information was missing, the analysis moved beyond hindsight judgment and toward a more realistic understanding of how engineers operate within imperfect systems. This approach reinforced the importance of documentation, communication, and accountability in large-scale engineering projects.

The course also emphasized definitional clarification and ethical frameworks drawn from professional engineering codes, including those of ASME and related organizations. Concepts such as safety, transparency, accountability, and integrity were examined from multiple stakeholder perspectives, demonstrating how different definitions can lead to different ethical conclusions. Applying these frameworks required balancing competing priorities—such as safety, schedule, cost, and regulatory compliance—while recognizing that certain principles, particularly public safety, consistently take precedence in professional engineering practice.

Overall, MAE 4300 strengthened my ability to evaluate engineering decisions beyond their technical correctness and consider their broader societal implications. The course reinforced that responsible engineering does not require adversarial thinking, but rather clear reasoning, structured analysis, and an awareness of how technical decisions affect the many involved stakeholders. This perspective has influenced how I approach engineering work by encouraging thoughtful judgment, effective communication, and an appreciation for the role engineers play in maintaining public trust.
