During my time at GlobalFoundries I worked under a manager and a mentor who helped me understand the ins and outs of semiconductor manufacturing. In my role on Lithography's Track Team I worked on three projects that allowed me to get an idea of what an equipment engineer does and gained skills to be able to perform in that capactity.

## Falling Fab Panels

**Problem:**
Press fit plastic clips on Track machine sub-op panels needed to be taken off or replaced because they were easily damaged when kicked or removed incorrectly.

- Determined magnets could be used for easier connection that would not be damaged.
- Found neodymium magnets of good size and designed a 3D printed cover that could hold the magnet and go into the place where the old plastic piece used to be.

**Solution:**

- Worked with GF Global Parts Solutions and consulted to confirm they could 3D print the pieces I needed
    - Made 2-3 versions to ensure a snug fit (went with 0.01” tolerance)
- Just needed a screwdriver, the magnets, and the printed pieces
- Replaced the 3-4 plastic press fits on panels with magnets in those same places

## DVR Computer Replacement

**Problem:**
Old Digital Video Recorder (DVR) computers had small memory that only allowed live feed to be useful, and live feed could only be viewed on Track panel inside Fab.

![Old DVR]({{ "/assets/images/old-dvr.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-1 style="width: 250px"} 

**Solution:**

- Replaced each large DVR computer inside a series of Track machines with smaller, larger memory computers
    - Ran cables under, through, then into machines and connected them to new computers so a signal could be set up to view the feed outside the Fab environment
- DVRs were then connected to software created by my mentor through the installed cables.
![New DVR]({{ "/assets/images/new-dvr.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-r style="width: 250px"}
    - Live feed accessible outside Fab environment
    - Recorded feed that could be viewed for much longer than before due to greater memory

## Track Machine Camera Mount

**Problem:**
One of the older series of track machines did not have cameras inside to be able to view processes and conditions inside.

**Solution:**

- Created two 3D printed pieces to be able to mount a camera inside older Lithography Track machine series to be able to monitor conditions inside it
    - Worked with GF Global Parts Solutions to iterate and 3D print mount that camera could screw into, and could screw into metal mounting position within machine

- Made prototype to test fit with camera and pounting position inside machine. Sent file off to be made out of aluminum once complete.
