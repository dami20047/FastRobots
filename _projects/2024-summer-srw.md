I worked at SRW Engineering & Architecture as a Mechanical Engineering Intern. The work I did was largely creating CAD drawings for existing spaces that the company was revamping or constructing, as well as working on proposals and presentations to communities where we were constructing something new. I also participated in site visits, doing load calculations for cooling, and prospective client meetings.

- Went on roof to take measurements of current rooftop downblast fan
- Looked for other options for fans that could also fulfill the cooling load required for the building

- Needed proposal for rezoning to allow the construction of multi-unit family housing for veterans and their families
- Worked on designing sizes of backyards, walkways, and right-of-ways that were all up to code
- Community sadly voted against building the housing in their area
    - Could design housing that did not require zoning proposals, so no need for community opinion
    - Could develop on another piece of land that might also work
