<!-- Intro paragraph -->
This course focuses on a systems level design and implementation of fast and dynamic autonomous robots. The course has students design a fast autonomous car exploring dynamic behaviors, acting forces, sensors, and reactive control on an embedded processor, as well as the benefit of partial off-board computation. We learned to derive design specifications from abstract problem descriptions and gained familiarity with rapid prototyping techniques, system debugging, system evaluation, and online dissemination of work.
